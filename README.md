## Usage

## Common problems

### TeamCity starts virtual machine but agent is not connected

To retrieve server configuration details, the TeamCity build agent needs to read the following files:

* `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\AzureData\CustomData.bin` on Windows
* `/var/lib/waagent/ovf-env.xml` in Linux

Please check that user under which TeamCity build agent is running has read access permissions to the mentioned files.

### TeamCity starts virtual machine instance but agent is Unauthorized

To resolve it please add the following line in the [buildagent.properties](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCDL/Build+Agent+Configuration) file:
```
azure.instance.name=<agent_name>
```
where `<agent_name>` should coincide with the vm name of running cloud instance.

### Container instance-based images are reporting problem "Microsoft.ContainerInstance is not available in xxx region"

You need to [register "Microsoft.ContainerInstance" provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services) in your subscription.

### Problems investigation
